# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:

# The include? method is called on the string "Hello World"
# The argument "Hello" is passed, the include? method checks to see if the string includes a the argument. 
# The return value is True 
"Hello World".include?("Hello")

# the end_with? method is called on the string "Hello World" 
# The argument "Hello" is passed, the end_with? method checks to see if the string ends with the argument 
# The return value is False 
"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

# the end_with? method is called on the string "Hello World"
# The argument "Hello" is passed, the end_with? method checks to see if the string ends with the argument 
# The return value is True 
"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

# The .even? method is called on the integer 12
# no arguments are passed, .even checks to see if the integer is even
# The return value is True =
12.even?

# The .next method is called on the integer 18
# no arguments are passed, .next lists the next interger (+1) 
# The return value is 19
18.next
