# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
Overall i feel comfortable using built in ruby methods, however memorizing them may prove a bit difficult

At first i was having trouble writing methods, just the order of things was a bit confusing, however i was able to resolve my problems by asking friends.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
How often are built in methods used?
